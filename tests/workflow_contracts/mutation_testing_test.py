"""Contract tests for the mutation-testing caller workflow.

The executable logic lives in the ``leynos/shared-actions`` reusable
workflow, which carries its own unit and integration tests; mapsplice's
caller is declarative configuration. These tests parse the caller with
PyYAML and assert that it references the correct reusable workflow at a
commit SHA, and that other structural properties (permissions, triggers,
feature-flag configuration) hold, so drift (repointing the pin at a
branch, widening permissions, or losing the feature-flag configuration)
fails CI on the pull request rather than surfacing in a scheduled or
manual run. Dependabot owns the pinned SHA value; these tests do not
assert which SHA is pinned.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
